                    Hivebreaker is an alien platformer shooter game in which the character Mason

                    must fight to survive, while also trying to get as many kills as possible.<br>
                    It's harder than it looks!<br><br>

                    This game was made using C++ and Raylib, while the assets were created in Aseprite, Tiled, Photoshop, and Spine.<br><br>

                <p>
                    This is a fun little project I've taken on within the last year to transform the inside of my car into it's own little flower garden!<br><br>
                    As of now, only the front half of the car has been decked out in flowers, however there's still over 160 flowers here alone!<br><br>

                    Each flower is made using crochet.<br><br>
                    
                    It's time consuming, but I'm loving the results!
