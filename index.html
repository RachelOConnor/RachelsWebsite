                <p>
                    <img src="../Portfolio Website/assets/img/pfp.jpg" alt="a picture of me!" id="pfp"> 
                    My name's Rachel and I'm currently in my third year of studing Interactive Digital Art and Design in SETU.
                    I have a passion for 2D art, UI design as well as developing websites.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I love to take part in creating games, whether it be for Game Jam, Games Fleadh, or even the Ploughing Championships.
                    There's just something about creating something from scratch that's super satisfying!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I'm not busy developing websites or creating games, I like to bake sweet treats or crochet some new flowers for my car.
                    I still have many more flowers to make!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm always looking for some new recipes to try or new crochet patterns to attempt, so send some my way!

                <p>I participated in Games Fleadh 2025, hosted in TUS Thurles, along with my team from SETU Carlow. <br><br>
            We entered our game Hivebreaker into the competition, which won us an award! <br><br>
            My role in this team was creating and animating characters using Aseprite and Spine. I also used Aseprite for other items
            such as achievements and icons.</p>

                <p>I created a browser game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with the intention to promote peace at the Ploughing Championships.<br><br>
                    The game was advertised within the Kildare & Leighlin Diocese stand at the Ploughing and was available to play through a scannable QR
                    code.

                <h3>CAPACITY - Abbey Theatre</h3>
                <p>I took part in a Fighting Words playwright programme, co-founded by Roddy Doyle and Sean Love, 
                    which involved drafting and writing individual plays with the aid of professionals. <br><br>
                    During the programme, I honed my playwright skills to create a play called "Tackling a Tickler",
                    which was performed by actors in the Abbey Theatre in front of an audience!<br><br>
                    We named our collection of plays "CAPACITY".
